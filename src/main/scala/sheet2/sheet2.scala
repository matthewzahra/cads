2c

The lock must be reentrant as to execute transfer, first we must acquire the lock (since the method is wrapped in lock.mutex).
We then execute withdraw(amount) - this acts on the same object, and is also wrapped in lock.mutex (referring to the same lock).
Therefore, if the lock is not reentrant, we will deadlock here, as we will try to acquire a lock that we arleady hold - this will therefor only work if we allow this, which is the definition of a reentrant lock


2d
The current issue is as follows.
Let's say that we want to transfer X money to some other account, but we have less than X currently in our account - we would like this to essentially wait until we have at least X in our account.
Our thread acquires the mutex, calls withdraw(amount) and then waits on a condition.
Let's say that another thread then tries to deposit in our account. We note, that when we awaited inside the withdraw, this released teh withdraw mutex, but did not release the 
mutex for transfer (they are off the same lock, each await decreases teh hold counter by 1, and another thread can only acquire it if this counter is 0). This causes other threads
to not be bale to acquire the lock - this means no one can ever actually deposit or withdraw anything, and so we reach a deadlock.
